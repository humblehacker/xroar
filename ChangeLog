 * Fixed OpenGL resize problem.
 * Fixed OpenGL border alignment problem.
 * Trace mode now disassembles instructions.
 * Virtual floppy timings more accurate, 'formatting' supported.
 * JVC virtual disk format supported.

 * Various command-line options added.

Changed from v0.11 to v0.12
 * New OpenGL video driver.  Allows architectures without Xv extension
   but with fast 3D graphics card to do hardware scaling.
 * Disk writing (in memory only).
 * Address-dependent CPU rate implemented (GP32 clock rate upped to
   80MHz to cope).

Changes from v0.10 to v0.11

 * Modularised almost everything.  Binary can contain multiple drivers
   for video, sound and ui.  User can pick one on startup and, hopefully,
   switch between them on the fly.
 * Added resizable SDL-YUV (Xv-accelerated where possible) video module.
 * Added JACK sound module.
 * Added NULL sound module (Linux-only: uses /dev/rtc to sync).
 * Eliminated busy-wait from SDL sound module.
 * Unified Unix and GP32 Makefiles.
 * Added ability to simulate NTSC video artifacts for hi-res graphics.
 * Sound fixes for unsigned audio interferes less with other audio.
 * GP32 chatboard support (thanks to Mirko's SDK).
 * Added 'translation' mode to SDL keyboard driver.
 * Added French & German keyboard mappings for 'raw' mode to SDL driver.
 * Ctrl+D (insert disk) replaced with Ctrl+[1-4] in SDL interface.

Changes from v0.9 to v0.10

 * Fixed Sun audio code broken by v0.9.
 * Fix SEX bug.  Pretty much everything runs correctly now (including
   Racer Ball, Rommel 3D, Android Attack).
 * Stopped using GP32 SDK sound code, adapted some of Jouni 'Mr.Spiv'
   Korhonen's code.
 * Refactored code to something a little more logical.
 * MacOS X 'Carbon' UI contributed by Stuart Teasdale.
 * Use C99 types instead of SDL ones except in SDL-based drivers.
 * Wrote faster GP32-specific VDG routines.

Changes from v0.8 to v0.9

 * More timing fixes.
 * Video rendering optimisations.
 * s/LICENCE/COPYING/
 * Basic GP32 menu system added.
 * Ability to switch between Dragon and CoCo ROMs and keymaps.
 * Can insert disks (but still only into drive 1).

Changes from v0.7 to v0.8

 * Added GTK interface option (default) to Unix build.
 * Timing fixes - most things play at a better speed now.

Changes from v0.7-pre1 to v0.7

 * Added basic Unix joystick support (using SDL).
 * PIA0 addressing more specific (D64-style), OS-9 boots!
 * PIA implementation simplified.
 * Debug level configurable at build time (defaults to "not too much").
 * Keyboard handling changed; GP32 version will be easier to switch to
   CoCo mode when the time comes.
