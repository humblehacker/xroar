Changes from v0.10 to v0.11

	* Modularised almost everything.  Binary can contain multiple drivers
	  for video, sound and ui.  User can pick one on startup and,
	  hopefully, switch between them on the fly.
	* Added resizable SDL-YUV (Xv-accelerated where possible) video module.
	* Added JACK sound module.
	* Added NULL sound module (Linux-only: uses /dev/rtc to sync).
	* Eliminated busy-wait from SDL sound module.
	* Unified Unix and GP32 Makefiles.
	* Added ability to simulate NTSC video artifacts for hi-res graphics.
	* Sound fixes for unsigned audio interferes less with other audio.
	* GP32 chatboard support (thanks to Mirko's SDK).
	* Added 'translation' mode to SDL keyboard driver.
	* Added French & German keyboard mappings for 'raw' mode to SDL driver.
	* Ctrl+D (insert disk) replaced with Ctrl+[1-4] in SDL interface.

Changes from v0.9 to v0.10

	* Fixed Sun audio code broken by v0.9.
	* Fix SEX bug.  Pretty much everything runs correctly now (including
	  Racer Ball, Rommel 3D, Android Attack).
	* Stopped using GP32 SDK sound code, adapted some of Jouni 'Mr.Spiv'
	  Korhonen's code.
	* Refactored code to something a little more logical.
	* MacOS X 'Carbon' UI contributed by Stuart Teasdale.
	* Use C99 types instead of SDL ones except in SDL-based drivers.
	* Wrote faster GP32-specific VDG routines.

Changes from v0.8 to v0.9

	* More timing fixes.
	* Video rendering optimisations.
	* s/LICENCE/COPYING/
	* Basic GP32 menu system added.
	* Ability to switch between Dragon and CoCo ROMs and keymaps.
	* Can insert disks (but still only into drive 1).

Changes from v0.7 to v0.8

	* Added GTK interface option (default) to Unix build.
	* Timing fixes - most things play at a better speed now.

Changes from v0.7-pre1 to v0.7

	* Added basic Unix joystick support (using SDL).
	* PIA0 addressing more specific (D64-style), OS-9 boots!
	* PIA implementation simplified.
	* Debug level configurable at build time (defaults to "not too much").
	* Keyboard handling changed; GP32 version will be easier to switch to
	  Coco mode when the time comes.
