A probably-incomplete list of things left to do.

General

* Accurate representation of electrical characteristics of keyboard.


GP32

* Need to be able to enter your own filename using the virtual
  keyboard.
* Need ability to save a snapshot.  Mostly held up by needing a way to
  enter filenames.


Unix

* Proper menu, probably brought up with right-click.
