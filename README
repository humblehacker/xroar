XRoar - a Dragon/Tandy Coco emulator
Copyright 2003-2013 Ciaran Anscomb <xroar@6809.org.uk>


XRoar is a Dragon emulator that runs on a wide variety of platforms.
Due to hardware similarities, XRoar also emulates the Tandy Colour
Computer (CoCo) models 1 & 2.

This README contains extracts from the manual.  Binary packages
contain the full manual as a PDF, which is also available from the
XRoar home page (http://www.6809.org.uk/dragon/xroar.shtml).


Getting started
***************

To start, you will need to acquire (and maybe build) the software and
install it.  Pre-built binary packages are available from the XRoar
home page (http://www.6809.org.uk/dragon/xroar.shtml).  If one is not
available for your architecture, you will have to build from source.
XRoar should build and run on any POSIX-like system for which SDL
(http://www.libsdl.org/) is available.

Building from source code
=========================

If there is no binary package for your system, you will have to build
from source.  Before doing so, you should ensure you have the
dependencies required to build:

   * *GTK+*, the GIMP tookit, is used to provide (at least) a file
     requester on Linux and Unix builds.  It is available from the GTK+
     home page (http://www.gtk.org/).

   * *GtkGLExt*, an OpenGL extension to GTK+.  This is optional, but if
     present, a full GTK+ user interface can be presented.  Under
     Linux, this obviates the need for SDL entirely.  It is available
     from the GTK+ OpenGL Extension project page
     (http://projects.gnome.org/gtkglext/).

   * *SDL*, Simple Directmedia Layer, is used for video and audio
     output on most supported platforms.  It can be obtained from the
     SDL home page (http://www.libsdl.org/).

   * *libsndfile* is optional but recommended.  It allows XRoar to use
     audio files (such as WAVs) as a source for cassette input.  It is
     available on the libsndfile home page
     (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/).

   If you use a modern Linux or Unix distribution, it's likely that
most of these packages will be installed by default, or easily
available through its package management system.

   The actual build process should be fairly straightforward and
follows the same steps as many other software packages.  Unpack the
source code, change into the created source directory, run `configure'
and then if everything looks good, run `make'.  Example:

     $ gzip -dc xroar-0.29.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -
     $ cd xroar-0.29.2
     $ ./configure
     $ make

   `configure' will detect any optionally supported drivers like Sun
audio, OpenGL video, etc.

   By default, `configure' will set up an install _PREFIX_ of
`/usr/local', but this can be changed by using the `--prefix=PATH'
option.

   Once built, run `make install' to install the binary and info
documentation on your system.  ROM images should be placed either in
your home directory under `.xroar/roms/', or under the installation
directory at `_PREFIX_/share/xroar/roms/'.
