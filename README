XRoar - a Dragon/Tandy Coco emulator

The aim of this project is to develop a fully usable Dragon emulator for
Unix-like operating systems and the GP32 handheld device.  Because the
architecture of the Tandy CoCo 2 was very similar to the Dragon, it is
also possible to use it to emulate those machines too (the only major
differences are: ROM BASIC, keyboard layout).


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The macros for manipulating the condition code register are based on
those used in the MAME 6809 core (in particular, those involved with
calculating the 'V' bit).

The Mac OS X 'Carbon' file requester code was contributed by Stuart
Teasdale.

The rest is the result of reading too many datasheets.


COMPILING

To build the Unix version, edit 'Makefile' and uncomment whichever USE_*
lines are relevant to you.  Then type 'make'.

To build the GP32 version, edit 'Makefile' and make sure CC_GP32, AS_GP32
and OBJCOPY_GP32 are set appropriately.  Then type 'make xroar.fxe'.

To build the Windows32 version, edit 'Makefile' and make sure CC_WINDOWS32
refers to the correct cross-compiler and that WINDOWS32_PREFIX points to
your MinGW32 prefix.  Then type 'make xroar.exe'.

When building more than one version, be sure to type 'make clean' in
between builds, or else object files will remain that have been compiled
for a different platform.


INSTALLATION

Unix: Copy the file 'xroar' to somewhere in your path.

GP32: Upload the file 'xroar.fxe' to gp:/gpmm/.  The ROM files, all
      cassette images, snapshots and disk images should be in
      gp:/gpmm/dragon/.

You will need a copy of the Dragon or CoCo firmware ROMs.  If you don't
have the tools to transfer this from your original Dragon or CoCo, you
may find one somewhere on the web.  Although I personally think that
such ROMs should be freely available, the copyright holders may think
differently (and given that Microsoft wrote the BASIC ROM, it's quite
likely they do), so I don't feel comfortable offering them up myself.

If you want to use the virtual disk support, you will also need a DOS
firmware ROM.  Only the WD2797-based DragonDOS controllers are emulated.

Firmware ROMs can be either raw (".rom") or PC Dragon style (".dgn").
The base names to use for these files are:

Dragon 32               dragon32        (16K)
Dragon 64 ROM 1         d64rom1         (16K)
Dragon 64 ROM 2         d64rom2         (16K)
CoCo                    coco            (16K Extended BASIC ROM only)
SuperDOS E6             sdose6          (8K)
DragonDOS 1.0           ddos10          (8K)

DOS firmware ROMs are searched for in that order; there is currently no
way to specify use of a DragonDOS ROM if a SuperDOS ROM is available.

On the GP32, firmware ROMs must be in gp:/gpmm/dragon/.  For other builds,
they should either be in the current working directory (only option for
Windows32) when running the emulator, or in one of these directories:

Mac OS X        Library/XRoar/Roms              (System or user directory)
Other Unix      /usr/local/share/xroar/roms


UNIX CONTROLS

Full keyboard support plus:
Ctrl+[1-4] .... Insert ".vdk" virtual disk into drive 1-4.
Ctrl+A ........ Cycle through artifacted video modes (hi-res only).
Ctrl+B ........ Load CoCo ".bin" binary file.
Ctrl+C ........ Quit emulator.
Ctrl+E ........ Toggle DOS emulation on/off - reset to take effect.
Ctrl+H ........ Load ".hex" Intel HEX-record.
Ctrl+J ........ Cycle through joystick emulation modes (None, Left, Right).
Ctrl+K ........ Toggle between Dragon and CoCo keyboard layout.
Ctrl+L ........ Load a snapshot.
Ctrl+M ........ Toggle between Dragon and CoCo emulation (resets machine).
Ctrl+R ........ Soft reset.
Ctrl+Shift+R .. Hard reset.
Ctrl+S ........ Save a snapshot.
Ctrl+T ........ Insert ".cas" virtual cassette.
Ctrl+Shift+T .. Insert virtual cassette and autoload first program.
Ctrl+Z ........ Enable keyboard translation mode.

In translation mode, characters typed on the host keyboard are translated
into the correct sequence of keypresses required on the emulated machine
to achieve the same character.  This works well in BASIC and text-mode
OS-9, but not so well with the hi-res (GO51) OS-9 console driver.

Joystick support is very basic and unconfigurable at the moment, and is
based on using a PS2 controller through a PS2-USB converter (although any
joystick supported by the OS should work).  Alternatively, use joystick
emulation (Ctrl+J) to simulate a joystick with the cursor keys, with
Left Alt as fire.


GP32 CONTROLS

The controller can be cycled through four modes by pressing the left
shoulder button.  These modes are:

 * KEYBOARD - D-pad selects a key, B presses a key, hold down right
              shoulder button to press shift.
 * CURSORS  - D-pad map to Dragon cursor keys.  B is shift, A is space,
              right shoulder button is enter.
 * RIGHT JOYSTICK - D-pad controls right joystick motion.  B is fire
              button.  A is space, right shoulder button is enter.
 * LEFT JOYSTICK - D-pad controls left joystick motion, with other
              controls as with right joystick mode.

At any time, pressing select will bring up a menu allowing you to load
a snapshot, toggle DOS emulation, insert a tape or disk, switch between
Dragon & CoCo, switch keymaps and reset the machine.  At present, there
is no way to save a snapshot, but you can generate them with the Unix
version and upload them.

If the tape is accessed (eg, you typed 'CLOADM' or 'CLOAD'), you need
to remember to insert a cassette file (".cas") from the menu.


CASSETTE IMAGES

Tools exist online to generate ".cas" cassette images, but they only
work under DOS (or presumably Windows).  Check the software section of
http://www.dragon-archive.co.uk/ for details.  That site also includes
quite a few titles that have already been converted for your convenience.
If you wish to play the game 'Buzzard Bait' (an excellent Joust clone),
you'll *have* to download the version there, because the original
required a dongle to be inserted, and obviously I don't emulate that.
Please note that site's usage requirements, and don't abuse the archive.


SNAPSHOTS

Snapshot files are *not* compatible with the traditional ".pak" files
used in other emulators.  I may support them in future, but the file
format looks pretty horrible.  This snapshot format is subject to change,
but a snapshot made in this release may well work fine in later ones.
At the moment, the most reliable way of loading programs is to use
cassette images or virtual disks, but if you have a Unix-like box,
you'll probably want to generate snapshots for your own convenience.


BUGS

The horizontal sync interrupt doesn't seem to be quite right (e.g.,
Rommel's Revenge).

Resizing while using the OpenGL driver in Mac OS X doesn't work
(12" PowerBook + 10.4).
