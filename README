XRoar - a Dragon/Tandy Coco emulator
Copyright (C) 2003-2007 Ciaran Anscomb <xroar@6809.org.uk>


Homepage: http://www.6809.org.uk/dragon/xroar.shtml


The aim of this project is to develop a fully usable Dragon emulator for
Unix-like operating systems and the GP32 handheld device.  Because the
architecture of the Tandy CoCo 2 was very similar to the Dragon, it is
also possible to use it to emulate those machines too (the only major
differences are: ROM BASIC, keyboard layout).


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The macros for manipulating the condition code register are based on
those used in the MAME 6809 core (in particular, those involved with
calculating the 'V' bit).

The Mac OS X 'Carbon' file requester code is based on a contribution by
Stuart Teasdale.

The rest is the result of reading too many datasheets.


COMPILING

To build, run 'configure', then type 'make' if everything looks ok.
Run 'configure --help' for available options.

'configure' will attempt to determine which flags to pass to the compiler,
and which libraries to link against, including any optional libraries.

Use the '--host' switch to cross-compile.  For example:

        ./configure --host=arm-elf
    or: ./configure --host=i586-mingw32

If 'configure' is run from outside the source directory, object files
will be built in the current directory, keeping the source tree clean.


INSTALLATION

Unix: Copy the file 'xroar' to somewhere in your path.

GP32: Upload the file 'xroar.fxe' to gp:/gpmm/.  The ROM files, all
      cassette images, snapshots and disk images should be in
      gp:/gpmm/dragon/.

Windows: The file 'xroar.exe' needs to be run from the directory that
         contains your firmware ROMs.


USING XROAR

XRoar will emulate the following machines:

----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
 Machine        | Description
----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
 dragon32       | Dragon 32 (PAL)
 dragon64       | Dragon 64 (PAL)
 tano           | Tano Dragon (NTSC)
 coco           | Tandy Color Computer (PAL)
 cocous         | Tandy Color Computer (NTSC)
----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------

To select a machine, use the following command-line option:

  -machine MACHINE      emulated machine (-machine help for a list)

You will need a copy of the Dragon or CoCo firmware ROMs.  If you don't
have the tools to transfer this from your original Dragon or CoCo, you
may find one somewhere on the web.  Although I personally think that
such ROMs should be freely available, the copyright holders may think
differently (and given that Microsoft wrote the BASIC ROM, it's quite
likely they do), so I don't feel comfortable offering them up myself.

Firmware ROM images can be either raw (".rom") or PC Dragon style
(".dgn").  The following table lists which ROMs are required for each
emulated machine.  Note that from groups of similar ROMs (indicated
with a "-" before the first in the group), only one is required, but
they are searched for in the order given.

----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------
 Machine        | ROM                   | Size | Description
----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------
 dragon32       | - d32, dragon32       | 16K  | Dragon BASIC ROM
----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------
 dragon64       | - d64_1, d64rom1      | 16K  | 32K-mode BASIC ROM
 tano           | - d64_2, d64rom2      | 16K  | 64K-mode BASIC ROM 
----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------
 coco           | - bas13               | 8K   | Color BASIC 1.3
 cocous         |   bas12               | 8K   | Color BASIC 1.2
                |   bas11               | 8K   | Color BASIC 1.1
                |   bas10               | 8K   | Color BASIC 1.0
                | - extbas11            | 8K   | Extended Color BASIC 1.1
                |   extbas10            | 8K   | Extended Color BASIC 1.0
----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------

To override the per-machine defaults, use the following command-line
options:

  -bas FILENAME         specify BASIC ROM to use (CoCo only)
  -extbas FILENAME      specify Extended BASIC ROM to use
  -altbas FILENAME      specify alternate BASIC ROM (Dragon 64)
  -noextbas             disable Extended BASIC

Dragon machines all contain a complete version of Extended BASIC;
CoCo's are able to run with a much reduced "Color BASIC", with Extended
BASIC being optional.

XRoar supports virtual disks by emulating three different types of disk
controller cartridge (the default depending on which machine is
selected):

----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
 Controller     | Description
----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
 dragondos      | DragonDOS, Official DOS cartridge from Dragon Data Ltd
 delta          | Delta System, Premier Microsystems' DOS for the Dragon
 rsdos          | RSDOS, Tandy's DOS cartridge for use with the CoCo
----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to use the virtual disk support, you will also need a DOS
firmware ROM.  For each controller, here is a list of compatible ROM
image files that are searched for in order:

----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------
 Controller     | ROM                   | Size | Description
----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------
 dragondos      | - dplus49b            | 8K   | DOSplus 4.9B
                |   dplus48             | 8K   | DOSplus 4.8
                |   sdose6              | 8K   | SuperDOS E6
                |   sdose5              | 8K   | SuperDOS E5
                |   sdose4              | 8K   | SuperDOS E4
                |   ddos40              | 8K   | DragonDOS 4.0
                |   ddos15              | 8K   | DragonDOS 1.5
                |   ddos10              | 8K   | DragonDOS 1.0
----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------
 delta          | - delta, deltados     | 8K   | Delta System
----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------
 rsdos          | - disk11              | 8K   | Disk Extended Color BASIC 1.1
                |   disk10              | 8K   | Disk Extended Color BASIC 1.0
----------------+-----------------------+------+-------------------------------

To override the defaults, use the following command-line options:

  -dostype DOS          type of DOS cartridge (-dostype help for a list)
  -dos FILENAME         specify DOS ROM (or CoCo Disk BASIC)
  -nodos                disable DOS (ROM and hardware emulation)

Three virtual disk formats are supported:

----------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------
 Image format   | Extensions    | Description
----------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------
 DMK            | .dmk          | David Keil's custom format
 JVC            | .jvc, .dsk    | Jeff Vavasour's format, optional headers
 VDK            | .vdk          | Another format with header information
----------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------

Of these, DMK retains the most information about the actual layout of
the floppy disk, and is the only one that XRoar will recognise as
containing single-density data (as used by the Delta system).

Disk images can be modified in memory after loading, but image files
themselves are not yet updated.


FILE LOCATIONS

On the GP32, firmware ROMs must be in gp:/gpmm/dragon/.  For other builds,
they should either be in the current working directory (only option for
Windows32) when running the emulator, or in one of these directories:

 Mac OS X         ~/.xroar/roms or ~/Library/XRoar/Roms
 Other Unix       ~/.xroar/roms or /usr/local/share/xroar/roms

UNIX CONTROLS

Full keyboard support plus:
Ctrl+[1-4] ........ Insert a virtual disk into drive 1-4.
Ctrl+Shift+[1-4] .. Insert a blank virtual disk (40TSS) into drive 1-4.
Ctrl+A ............ Cycle through artifacted video modes (hi-res only).
Ctrl+C ............ Quit emulator.
Ctrl+E ............ Toggle DOS emulation on/off - reset to take effect.
Ctrl+I ............ Insert a cartridge.
Ctrl+Shift+I ...... Insert a cartridge, no autorun.
Ctrl+J ............ Cycle through joystick emulation modes (None, Left, Right).
Ctrl+K ............ Toggle between Dragon and CoCo keyboard layout.
Ctrl+L ............ Load a file (see below).
Ctrl+M ............ Toggle between Dragon and CoCo emulation (resets machine).
Ctrl+R ............ Soft reset.
Ctrl+Shift+R ...... Hard reset.
Ctrl+S ............ Save a snapshot.
Ctrl+W ............ Attach a virtual cassette file for writing.
Ctrl+Z ............ Enable keyboard translation mode (see below).

Loading a file with Ctrl+L autodetects the file type by extension, and
acts accordingly:

 * Disk files (".dmk", ".vdk", ".jvc", ".dsk") are inserted into drive 1.
 * Virtual cassettes (".cas") are attached.  If shift is also pressed,
   XRoar will attempt to autodetect their type and insert the appropriate
   load command ("CLOAD" or "CLOADM:EXEC") into the keypress buffer.
 * Hex records (".hex") will be loaded into memory.
 * CoCo binaries (".bin") will be loaded into memory and started from their
   EXEC address.
 * Snapshots (".sna") will continue from when they were saved.
 * Unrecognised filetypes are assumed to be audio files, and if XRoar
   is built with libsndfile, it will attempt to use them for cassette
   input.

Individual key bindings used for loading each type of file in previous
versions of XRoar have been kept for the moment as synonyms for Ctrl+L,
but this is deprecated and may be removed in future.

In translation mode, characters typed on the host keyboard are translated
into the correct keypresses required on the emulated machine to achieve
the same character.

Joystick support is very basic and unconfigurable at the moment, and is
based on using a PS2 controller through a PS2-USB converter (although any
joystick supported by the OS should work).  Alternatively, use joystick
emulation (Ctrl+J) to simulate a joystick with the cursor keys, with
Left Alt as fire.

Attaching a virtual cassette for writing will always truncate that file
to zero bytes even if you don't then write anything, so be careful you
don't overwrite something important.  Tape files used for writing and
those used for reading are maintained separately.


GP32 CONTROLS

The controller can be cycled through four modes by pressing the left
shoulder button.  These modes are:

 * KEYBOARD - D-pad selects a key, B presses a key, hold down right
              shoulder button to press shift.
 * CURSORS  - D-pad map to Dragon cursor keys.  B is shift, A is space,
              right shoulder button is enter.
 * RIGHT JOYSTICK - D-pad controls right joystick motion.  B is fire
              button.  A is space, right shoulder button is enter.
 * LEFT JOYSTICK - D-pad controls left joystick motion, with other
              controls as with right joystick mode.

At any time, pressing select will bring up a menu allowing you to load
a snapshot, toggle DOS emulation, insert a tape or disk, switch between
Dragon & CoCo, switch keymaps and reset the machine.  At present, there
is no way to save a snapshot, but you can generate them with the Unix
version and upload them.

If the tape is accessed (eg, you typed 'CLOADM' or 'CLOAD'), you need
to remember to insert a cassette file (".cas") from the menu.


CASSETTE IMAGES

Tools exist online to generate ".cas" cassette images, but they only
work under DOS (or presumably Windows).  Check the software section of
http://www.dragon-archive.co.uk/ for details.  That site also includes
quite a few titles that have already been converted for your convenience.
If you wish to play the game 'Buzzard Bait' (an excellent Joust clone),
you'll *have* to download the version there, because the original
required a dongle to be inserted, and obviously I don't emulate that.
Please note that site's usage requirements, and don't abuse the archive.

If libsndfile is detected while building, XRoar will use it to support
cassette loading from audio files.


SNAPSHOTS

Snapshot files are *not* compatible with the traditional ".pak" files
used in other emulators.  I may support them in future, but the file
format looks pretty horrible.  This snapshot format is subject to change,
but a snapshot made in this release may well work fine in later ones.
At the moment, the most reliable way of loading programs is to use
cassette images or virtual disks, but you'll probably want to generate
snapshots for your own convenience.
